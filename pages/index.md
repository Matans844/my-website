# About me
My name is Matan Sheskin. I am a programmer. I finished my computer science B.Sc. in March 2022. I also finished a Psychology B.A. in 2020, and I should finish my mathematics degree in 2024. I am interested in problem solving. More specifically, I am interested in problem patterns that make up problems in programming, computer science, and math. I build this website to share my thoughts, ideas, and code.

# Projects
Find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Matans844). Here are a few of my interesting public projects:

* [Image Caption Generator](https://github.com/Matans844/img2capt-Deep-Learning-Image-Caption-Generator): A pre-trained CNN encoder passes image features to a combined RNN LSTM encoder that generates textual captions to input images. Written in Python using Pytorch.
* [4-in-A-Row game](https://github.com/Matans844/C21-Ex05-Matan-4-or-more-In-A-Row-Game): Modifiable board dimensions. Two game modes: Player vs. Player and Player vs. Computer. Decoupled logic and UI. Written in C\# and .NET.
* [Server-Client mach-messaging IPC on Mac](https://github.com/Matans844/Server-Client-Mach-IPC-on-Mac): The client can locate the server and send/receive data. The server can save data up to 1024 bytes and send it to authorized clients. Written in objective-C.
* [DNS Sinkhole Server](https://github.com/Matans844/DNS-Sinkhole-Server): Non-block-list DNS records are sent as queries to other DNS servers. A packet handler extracts query responses from reply packets. Written in Java.
